I want to learn how to merge files through eclipse and gitbash.
Will it work?
I have made changes but I'm unable to commit.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Why won't this method work?

So After trying the gitbash, it worked. not sure if eclipse is the problem. will try it again now.

In this local branch I want to verify there is a difference in the two.
