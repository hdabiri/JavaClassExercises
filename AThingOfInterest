How Long it will take to Memorize the Qur'an
==============================================

This program is to calculate how long it will take to memorize the entire Qur'an based on number of lines per day.
 * There are 8,815 lines in the Noble Qur'an.
 * Depending on how many lines per day the participant enters in the program, 
 * it will calculate how many days it will take to complete the memorization of the entire Qur'an.
 
 Attributes:
 * I will have to create multiple variables to store several components of the code.
 * Variables such as Years, Months, days, and total number of lines. 
 
 Operations:
 * I will need to collect the data from the user about how many lines they plan to memorize per day.
   This will be done using the Scanner method to collect input from the user. 
 * I will need to use arithmetic expressions to calculate how long the memorizationw ill take,
   based on the input collected from the user and the fixed factors (number of lines in the Qur'an).
 
 
 Assumptions:
 * In this code I have assumed that a month is 30 days long and that a year is 365 days. 
 * It does not account for leap years and days that are shorter or longer than 30
 * This is important to make the program easier to code at this stage of my learning process. 
 * I have also excluded the lines of the Quran that are surah headers and Bismillah.
 * These normally amount to 227 lines. (114*2 = 228. subtracting 1 line for the absence of bismillah for surat Taubah = 227)
 * I manually counted the lines for suratul Faatihah and the first page of Suratul Baqarah because they are not full pages.
