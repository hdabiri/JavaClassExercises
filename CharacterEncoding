i. Why do we need encoding?
Computers do not understand the language we speak as humans.
They function on electrical pulses and we easily represent those with 0s and 1s.
Therefore whenever we interact with a computer, our data must be decoded (changed from e.g. English, to 0s and 1s).
The computer then uses the format it understands, and processes our request.
AFterwards, the computer encodes its results (converts the 0s and 1s back to English) for us to understand. 

ii. What are the available options?
There are several options for encoding data, based on the code unit size.
Some of them consist of code units using 7 bits (ASCII), some have 8 bits (UTF-8), some have 16 bits (UTF-16), and another has 32 bits (UTF-32).

iii. What encoding standard is common today?
The most common encoding standard today is Unicode. It is an encoding standard that unifies all other encoding standard. 
ASCII is the de-facto baseline for all encodings, and it maps 1:1 unto UTF-8 (Unicode with 8 bits).

iv. How is character encoding related to fonts?
Fonts are various glyphs used to represent specific characters. Computers only understand certain codes/code points that are used to represent fonts.
Each font is mapped to a specific code point in order for the computer to understand it and use it.
